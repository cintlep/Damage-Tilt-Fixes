This mod fixes leftover issues from the 1.19.4 damage tilt reimplementation, restoring accurate 1.2.5 singleplayer behavior. It also adds tilting from explosion sources, a feature that 1.2.5 originally doesn't have. All without any dependencies.

This fixes the following:

MC-259212 - Directional damage tilt is still used for non-directional damage sources after taking damage from a directional damage source
MC-298499 - Damage tilt doesn't tilt from explosion source
